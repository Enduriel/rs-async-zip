//! A ZIP reader which acts over a non-seekable source.
//!
//! # API Design
//! As opposed to other readers provided by this crate, it's important that the data of an entry is fully read before
//! the proceeding entry is read. This is as a result of not being able to seek forwards or backwards, so we must end
//! up at the start of the next entry.
//!
//! **We encode this invariant within Rust's type system so that it can be enforced at compile time.**
//!
//! This requires that any transition methods between these encoded types consume the reader and provide a new owned
//! reader back. This is certainly something to keep in mind when working with this reader, but idiomatic code can
//! still be produced nevertheless.
//!
//! # Considerations
//! As the central directory of a ZIP archive is stored at the end of it, a non-seekable reader doesn't have access
//! to it. We have to rely on information provided within the local file header which may not be accurate or complete.
//! This results in:
//! - No file comment being avaliable (defaults to an empty string).
//! - No internal or external file attributes being avaliable (defaults to 0).
//! - The extra field data potentially being inconsistent with what's stored in the central directory.
//! - None of the following being avaliable when the entry was written with a data descriptor (defaults to 0):
//!     - CRC
//!     - compressed size
//!     - uncompressed size
//!
//! # Example
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::io::Cursor;
//! # use async_zip::error::Result;
//! # use async_zip::read::stream::ZipFileReader;
//! #
//! # async fn run() -> Result<()> {
//! let mut zip = ZipFileReader::new(Cursor::new([0; 0]));
//!     
//! // Print the name of every file in a ZIP archive.
//! while let Some(entry) = zip.next_entry().await? {
//!     println!("File: {}", entry.entry().filename());
//!     zip = entry.skip().await?;
//! }
//! #
//! #     Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
